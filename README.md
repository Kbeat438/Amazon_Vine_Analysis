# Summary:
Unfortunately, this data is inconclusive to decide weather there is any positivity bias for customers in the Vine program. This is due to there being 40,471 non-Vine rewiews and only 94 Vine reviews. The two samples are too far apart in magnitude to produce any relevant results. a larger sample of reviews in the Vine program would have to be procured to produce meaningful results. Because this difference is so vast, the dataset i choose would not benefit from additional analysis. If, however, the dataset had more comparable samples; we could find out more accurately if the Vine program has a positivity bias on 5 star reviews by filtering the data for verified purchases to make sure the product was obtained by the customer and it is an accurate review.
